        <h1>Welcome to my personal project!</h1>
        <p class="text">What is my personal project? My personal project is to create a world-famous video game.
            Ever since I was a little boy, I've been passionate about video games, especially the
            Assassins Creed. This game, which attracts millions of players with each release of an episode in the series
            The theme of the game is assassins and templars at war across the centuries.
            As I'm passionate about this game, I'd like to make my game around this theme to try to
            attract players on a global scale. To be able to do this project, I'm going to have to go through
            different stages to make this video game, which are as follows: designing the game
            game by coming up with an idea for the game and the design document, the
            pre-production, which involves planning the project and creating storyboards and prototypes, 
            production, which involves developing the game and
            artistic and sound design, fixing bugs and optimising the game as far as possible
            optimising the game as much as possible, distributing the game, i.e. launching it and
            marketing, post-launch support, which involves updating the game so that
            updates to ensure the game is ready for release, as well as customer support, and finally
            performance analysis and feedback from certain players, i.e. iteration.
